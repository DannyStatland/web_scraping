    "    \n",
    "Here is for instance the minutes of the last Fed meeting:\n",

    "    \n",
    "My goal is to predict the S&P500 index direction in the next week based on what is written in the FED minutes announcement. I will start by scraping the relevant pages with Selenium, then I will build a classifier based on the various features I can extract from the FED minutes. I will train the classifier based on the historic movements of the S&P500 index. \n",
    "Another approach I will be using is to vectorize the texts by Tfidf using Loughran-McDonald financial dictionary and calculate the cosine similarity between two consecutive meetings. This value is the degree of change in the text direction (i.e. cosine of vectors), which may indicate the policy change, and would be tested for correlation with the S&P500 index movement. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Edit: as for 15.02.2022 I have only finished the scraping section, then extracting nominal FED market recommendations out of the text and adding S&P500 data from the days following each meeting. \n",
    "Stay tuned for the upcoming modeling training and prediction using tf-idf and cosine similarity.</b>"
